Enterprise Data Warehousing - Real estate database management system

In Berlin, a prominent real estate agency, Berealty, manages an extensive portfolio of
properties, ranging from residential apartments to commercial spaces. Berealty offers
property listings, client management, and transaction processing. To streamline
operations and enhance efficiency, Berealty decide to develop a comprehensive Real
Estate Property Management Database. This robust system is designed to centralize
and organize all essential data, including property details, client information, agent
records, and transaction history. The Real Estate Property Management Database
transforms how Berealty operates, providing a scalable solution that grows with the
business and continues to meet the evolving needs of the dynamic Berlin real estate
market.

1. Database Design for a Real Estate Agency:
• Define the scope and objectives of the database for the Real Estate Agency,
considering aspects like real estate properties, clients and/or tenants,
agents, transactions for a real estate agency, and more.
• Create a comprehensive Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that represents
the database structure. Use appropriate entities, attributes, relationships,
participation, and cardinalities.
• The ER diagram must align perfectly with the physical data structure (MySQL
tables) to avoid any discrepencies.
• The database should be properly normalized to avoid data redundancy.
• Provide a written explanation of your design choices, ER diagram, and the
rationale behind them, considering the specific needs of a real estate
agency.
2. Database Implementation:
• Implement the database design for the real estate agency in a MySQL
database management system.
• Create tables, define relationships, and constraints (e.g., primary keys,
foreign keys, unique, data types, lengths).
• Populate the database with sample data that reflects typical real estate
scenarios.
• SQL Query Writing (Applying - Level 3):
• Develop a series of SQL queries that demonstrate your understanding of
database manipulation within a real estate context.
• Include queries for properties information retrieval, transactions handled by
agents, transactions for clients, the management of properties, agents, and
clients, , transaction history, monthly, quarterly and yearly reports, and
more.
• Extract data involving multiple tables using JOIN operations (e.g. INNER
JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, CROSS JOIN) to provide comprehensive
reports.
• Write complex queries that involve JOIN operations and subqueries for
advanced real estate operations.
• Define and implement SQL triggers to automate certain actions, such as,
updating the property status when a transaction is completed.
